      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

# Miguel Angel Luque Fernandez, BSc, MA, MPH, MSc, PhD
My Academic Website: [MALF](https://maluque.netlify.app)  
https://maluque.netlify.app/  
  
I received my PhD in Preventive Medicine (Epidemiology) and Public Health, awarded Summa Cum Laude, from the University of Granada (UGR, Spain) and the ULB (Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium). Also, I hold a BSc in Mathematics and Statisticas from the Open University, an MSc in Biostatistics from the University of Newcastle, Australia, an MSc in Epidemiology from the ULB and, an MPH and health management from the UGR. After the completion of my Ph.D. in 2010, I moved to the Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research (University of Cape Town) as a postdoctoral fellow for two years. Afterwards, I moved to the Harvard School of Public Health (Department of Epidemiology), where I specialized in epidemiological methods from 2012 to 2015. I have also been trained as an Epidemic Intelligence Officer (EIS), and I worked as a field epidemiologist for several years in different African countries with Médecins Sans Frontières and GOARN-WHO during the Cholera epidemic in Haiti, 2010. 

My research interests lie principally, but not exclusively in the field of epidemiological methods and comparative effectiveness research. At UCT, I used marginal structural models applied to large longitudinal data from Khayelitsha (HIV-Cohort) to assess the effectiveness of an observational, nonrandomized intervention [Club of Patients](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0056088). At Harvard, I used fixed effects methods in the context of the analysis of the components of the variance and within siblings design (observational cross-over) to evaluate the effect of a small [fetoplacental ratio](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25630563) at birth on the risk of delivering a small for gestational age infant. 

Currently, I am developing in collaboration with colleagues from the ICON group at the LSHTM data-adaptive methods for model selection and evaluation based on cross-validation techniques [cvAUROC](https://github.com/migariane/cvAUROC) and applying advanced causal inference methods such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation [TMLE](https://github.com/migariane/eltmle) to study social inequalities in cancer outcomes and survival. Furthermore, I am developing web applications to disseminate advanced causal inference methods and concepts i.e., [colliders](https://watzile.shinyapps.io/EpiCollider/).
